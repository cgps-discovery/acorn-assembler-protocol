# About the CGPS Assembler app

The team at the [Centre for Genomic Pathogen Surveillance](https://www.pathogensurveillance.net) has designed this application to offer a user-friendly genome assembly workflow. This process includes implementing quality control measures on the raw sequencing data to optimize it for assembly. Subsequently, the application utilizes the [`Spades`](https://github.com/ablab/spades) assembler and gathers quality metrics throughout the workflow. These metrics are then presented alongside the final assembly in `fasta` format.
